# fumble

Bumble but for your images. Interactively delete images. 



As a hobbyist photographer, I often found myself overwhelmed after photo sessions. With hundreds of images to review and about 60% of them destined for deletion, the process of sorting through them was time-consuming and tedious. This was the frustration that led me to build Fumble – a tool to make this process faster and more enjoyable.

But it's not just for photographers. We've all been there – that neglected downloads folder filled with screenshots, memes, and images we no longer need. Fumble turns the daunting task of cleaning up these digital spaces into a quick and almost enjoyable experience.
